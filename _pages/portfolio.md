The Merck-Purdue Data Mine Model is a novel method of engagement for industry geared towards systematically training future data scientists to operationalize data science in R&D.

In this collaboration, students are provided open-ended non-proprietary research prompts along with use-cases.

Teams are run using agile and scrum methods with a TA/Technical lead and Merck Mentor responsible for designing and developing solutions in sprints.Technical roles are designed and shifted based on student interests and technical skill progression and MRL prioritization.

Teams deliver solutions to problem statements:

- developing PoCs with state-of-the-art technologies
- troubleshooting within the MRL developing
- driven by Merck technical and behavioral performance evaluations

Basically -- they're given the internship experience without taking 6 months off.

Meaning: I'm responsible for safety and compliance trainings 45 contracted students.

45 direct reports within workday.
