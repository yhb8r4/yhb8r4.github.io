**Description:** The rapidly growing biomedical information in natural language is a huge challenge for systematic literature review in drug research and development (R&D).

This project will focus on mining experimental conditions from biomedical literatures and electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) using natural language processing (NLP) to guide assay optimization for new drug candidates.

Keywords: **Python, machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), AWS, SQL, Drug Research and Development**
