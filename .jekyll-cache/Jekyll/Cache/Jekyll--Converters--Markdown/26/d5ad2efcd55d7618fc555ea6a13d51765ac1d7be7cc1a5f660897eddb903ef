<p><em>Feb 2021 â€“ Present</em></p>

<p>Project descriptionCompliance requirements for data capture within ELN, require a multi-step process of initial authorship followed by secondary scientist review (SSR). Often, this process is iterative and spans several electronic lab notebooks notebooks (ELNs), processed attachments, and raw instrument data that was created several years back. Hence, the opportunity to streamline the process of machine-aided congruency between documents prior SSR is highly desired.</p>

<p>Here I worked on the development of an automated tool that can aid scientist in the SSR review process of ELN documentations and technical reports in the form of a interactive web-based interface that is capable of ingesting multiple ELN attachment template that can check for congruency prior to the initial SSR process.</p>
