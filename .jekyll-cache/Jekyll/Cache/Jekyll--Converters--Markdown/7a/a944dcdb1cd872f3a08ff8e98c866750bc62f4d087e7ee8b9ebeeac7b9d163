<p><em>Aug 2020 – Present</em></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The Merck-Purdue Data Mine RFID team is developing a platform that communicates with a third party vendor SimplyRFID POGI API with a custom-built Merck-Purdue RFID API to retrieve geo-location information for dummy sample inventory, merges the geo-location of various samples with information such as “formulation”, “stress condition”, etc., and enables visualization of samples on an web-based dashboard.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to build a data pipeline that can populate a centralized database with coupled sample submission and dynamic location information on which to perform statistical analysis and apply machine learning models to enable forecasting and predictive models for drug substance and drug product formulation development.</p>

<p>In regard to business value, the platform tools and future analysis of this RFID-dependent data will assist Merck formulators with the logistical aspects of sample inventory management and increase efficiency in the drug development process by expediting information retrieval, reducing experimental redundancy, and enabling inventory forecasting.</p>

<p>Also, T-shirts.</p>

<p>Next stage for the RFID POC is to begin a steady stream of on-boarding samples with RFID tags</p>
